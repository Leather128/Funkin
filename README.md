# Leather's Funkin' Engine

This is the repository for Leather's Funkin' Engine, an engine created for making and playing mods for Friday Night Funkin'.

## Build Instructions

For build intructions go to [Build.md](https://github.com/Leather128/LeathersFunkinEngine/blob/master/Build.md)

## Features

> Proper Options Menu

This includes things like custom controls, downscroll, opponent note glow, etc.

> 1-10 Key Support

What does this mean? Well, now if you want, you can choose a different amount of arrows / keys! (Aka different from 4), this feature only goes up to 10 however, because anything more than that would probably be too intensive and would use a lot of resources (also yes 1 key is a thing lol).

> Full mod support with Polymod!

Support for custom songs, characters, stages, weeks, basic cutscenes (videos and dialogue), all without modifying the source code! All you have to do is follow a guide that I will be making in the future and then you can make as many mods as you want!

> New Input System

A new input system that well, isn't really similar to anything since I built it off of the input from the base game. This new system, has no ghost tapping but instead has an anti-mash system that may take some time to get used to.

> More to come...
